# TODO List Challenge (Elixir/Phoenix LiveView)

After a couple hours without sleep (72 hours of work)... Here it is. The TODO List Challenge!
So, today i gonna show you the result of my hard work doing this amazing challenge. Basically, the challenge is: 
"You need to create a TODO list using Phoenix LiveView that solve the challenge FrontEnd Mentor".

And that's what i did:

Here you can see some interactions with the TODO list.

And here, is possible to see how the filter works. You can show all the items or just the actives or unmarked, you choose!

As you can see, the website work with a dark and light mode too. For this one, i chose to make using Javascript.
Basically whith some <b>"QuerySelector"</b> and some <b>CSS</b>, you can do too much things in Javascript.

And last but not least, the (bonus) drag and drop function. After a couple hours studying and thinking how could i do this, i decided to use the <b>SortableJS</b>, which is a Javascript lib that allow you to 
in an easier way, create drag and drop components. This function is not 100% cause unfortunelly, doesn't store the position of the items. If you swich the items, when you refresh the page, they back to the first position. But i'm looking for how im supose to store the informations in a database.

Well, it was three days of a lot of learning. I loved to develop something in a functional programming language. And if you have any question, ask me!
